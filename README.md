# C-internet-browser-example-2-
The purpose of this program is to construct a multi-threaded web server using POSIX threads (pthreads) in the
C language to learn about thread programming and synchronization methods. Your web server should be
able to handle these file types: HTML, GIF, JPEG, TXT, and of any arbitrary size. It should handle a
limited portion of the HTTP web protocol (namely, the GET command to fetch a web page / file).
